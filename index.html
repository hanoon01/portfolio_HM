    <p style="max-width:600px;">Over the years, I've developed a strong passion for software development, problem-solving, and user-centered design. While I haven’t officially worked in the field yet, I’ve been actively learning and building personal projects to develop my skills. These include hardware programming with Arduino, web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and creating user-friendly designs for mock websites.
        <br><br>
        I’m especially fascinated by how technology interacts with human behavior, which has sparked my growing interest in UI/UX design. I enjoy exploring how to make digital experiences intuitive and accessible for everyone.
        <br><br>
        Outside of academics, I love reading about human development and history, which inspires me to think deeply and design thoughtfully. I'm always looking for opportunities to improve, grow, and bring creative ideas to life through code and design.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Vehicle Assembly & Motor Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a vehicle using Arduino, motors, and sensors</li>
        <li>Used PWM and H-Bridge for speed and direction</li>
        <li>Designed motor circuit board with Multisim</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Website Redesign (Mock)</h3>
      <p>Recreated a website using HTML, CSS, and animations. Focused on responsive layout and mobile-first design, or recreated the homepage of a website in Figma</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Code Practice & Experiments</h3>
      <p>Building small projects and experimenting with code snippets to improve my skills such as:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple Calculator: Built with Java, this calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and includes error handling for invalid input.</li><br>
        <li>Guess the Number Game: A fun game built with C++,where the user has to guess a randomly generated number with hints provided after each guess.</li><br>
        <li>Word Scramble Game: A console-based game where the player unscrambles letters to form a word. Written in Python, this project helped me practice string manipulation, loops, and basic game logic</li><br>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">
    I enjoy reading about human development, psychology, and history—especially how the past and human behavior shape our present. Books and documentaries that explore different cultures, civilizations, or innovations always catch my interest.
    <br><br>
    Outside of tech, I like to explore the creative side of design. I often sketch interface ideas or experiment with design tools like Figma to create layouts and UI mockups. These personal projects help me think visually and improve my design thinking.
    <br><br>
    I also find joy in the simple things—like cozy moments with a good book, a podcast on human behavior, or a strong cup of coffee while journaling ideas. Learning and growing—whether through reading or creating—is something I truly enjoy.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
     <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">
    My academic journey began at Queensborough Community College, where I studied Computer Engineering Technology. During that time, I built a solid foundation in hardware systems, circuit design, and low-level programming. It sparked my curiosity for how physical and digital systems work together.
    <br><br>
    I later transferred to Queens College to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This transition deepened my focus on software development, problem-solving, and logic-building. I've been learning web development, working on personal projects, and exploring UI/UX design through hands-on experience and independent learning.
